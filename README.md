# Building-a-Job-Description-and-Resume-Matching-System-With-Python-Using-Machine-Learning


This project aims to build a job description and resume matching system using Python with machine learning techniques. The system helps streamline the recruitment process by automatically matching job descriptions with submitted resumes, providing recruiters with a more efficient way to identify suitable candidates.

## Features

- **Job Description Input:** Recruiters can input job descriptions into the system.
- **Resume Upload:** Candidates can upload their resumes for matching against job descriptions.
- **Matching Algorithm:** The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to match job descriptions with resumes based on similarity scores.
- **Result Presentation:** Matched resumes are presented to recruiters with similarity scores and relevant details.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Backend development using Python programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend design and layout using Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly UI.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Libraries such as scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms for text similarity matching.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend markup and styling for web pages.
